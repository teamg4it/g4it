## Description

This use case allows a **project team** to upload Devices equipments by importing the files, into a digital service previously created.
The file type is  **physical equipment**.

The files should be in `.csv` or `.xlsx` format. For **CSV files** specifically, both commas and semicolons are
supported as delimiters. Regarding encoding formats, **UTF-8**, **UTF-8 with BOM**, and **Windows-1252** are supported;
other encoding formats, while untested, may also work.

**Navigation Path**
