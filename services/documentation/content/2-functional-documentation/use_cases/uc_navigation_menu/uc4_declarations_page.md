## Accessibility

The Declarations page follows accessibility best practices:

- The page includes clear headings, descriptive link text, and properly labeled images (`alt` and `title` attributes used).
- On keyboard navigation (Tab), the first focusable element receives focus as expected.
- **Internal links** open in the same tab for seamless navigation within G4IT.
- **External links** and downloadable documents open in a new tab, indicated to assistive technologies and screen reader users.
