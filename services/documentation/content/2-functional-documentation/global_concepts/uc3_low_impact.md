## Description

Low Impact Service – Business Explanation: The **Low Impact Service** determines whether a country can be considered environmentally **“low impact”** based on the quality of its electricity mix.

---

### Objective

To identify countries where electricity production has a **lower environmental impact**, so that equipment hosted in those countries can be flagged as **more sustainable**.

---

### Low Impact Logic

#### 1. Multiple environmental criteria are considered
These criteria represent environmental indicators (e.g. climate impact, resource depletion, etc.).

#### 2. Each country is ranked per criterion
For every criterion, countries are classified into **4 quartiles**:

- **Quartile 1** → Best environmental performance  
- **Quartile 4** → Worst environmental performance  

#### 3. A global score is calculated per country
The service:
- Takes the quartile ranking of each country across all criteria  
- Sums these quartile positions  

#### 4. Countries are compared against each other
All countries’ total scores are ranked again to determine their **position distribution**.

#### 5. Low Impact Definition
A country is considered **“Low Impact”** if:
- Its total environmental score falls within the **best 25% of countries**.
