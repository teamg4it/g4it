### Visualize a digital service without any account
A user with a G4IT account can generate and share a link to a digital service, allowing a recipient without a G4IT account to access and view the service in a read-only mode ***without authentication***.

The shared link enables the recipient to directly visualize the resources and results, with the link expiring after 60 days, although the sharer has the option to extend this expiration period.
