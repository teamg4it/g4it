## Overview

### Visualize a digital service without any account

A user with a G4IT account can generate and share a link to a digital service, allowing a recipient without a G4IT
account to access and view the service in a read-only mode ***without authentication***.

The shared link enables the recipient to directly visualize the resources and results, with the link expiring after 60
days, although the sharer can extend this expiration period.

### Import equipments in digital service via 'Import' button

In G4IT now there is a possibility to ***import csv*** files for the devices and networks, private infrastructures, and
public clouds - IaaS in a digital service.
