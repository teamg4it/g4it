### Enhanced DEMO Workspace for Feature Exploration

The DEMO workspace has been redesigned to better support the presentation and discovery of G4ITâ€™s features. This redesign introduces two major changes:

#### 1. Shared Digital Services Within Workspaces

Digital services are no longer visible only to their creators. From now on, any digital service created within a shared workspace will be accessible to all members of that workspace. This change promotes collaboration and transparency within teams.

#### 2. Migration of DEMO Services to Personal Workspaces

To ensure a clean and consistent DEMO environment, all digital services previously created by users in the DEMO workspace will be migrated to their respective personal workspaces. In these personal spaces, users will retain full control over access rights and can choose to share their services with specific users as needed.

### Decommissioning of Legacy Sharing Features

With the introduction of workspace-level sharing, the previous feature allowing individual service-level sharing has been **deprecated and decommissioned**. Sharing is now managed at the workspace level to simplify collaboration.

### DEMO Workspace: Read-Only by Default

To maintain the integrity of the DEMO environment, it will now be **read-only by default**. This ensures that all users can explore example services without modifying them.

Additionally, **data export will be enabled** in this read-only mode, allowing users to reuse the example services by importing them into their personal workspaces.
