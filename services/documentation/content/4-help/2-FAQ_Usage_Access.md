## Usage

{{% expand title="What is the difference between a Digital Service and an Application ?" expanded="false" %}}
This question is good because it is not so clear under the Sustainable IT Ecosystem or between to different context !
A **Digital Service** designates all the infrastructure use to adress the business act. 
It is composed of 3 tiers : **Users Devices** (Laptop, mobiles…), **Data Exchange on Network** (Go exchange on internet or LAN), and **servers**. Example of a digital service : order a train ticket, or Manage customer bill… 
We consider in G4IT an Application as the sum of all servers (physicals and virtuals) permit to a digital service to run.

{{% expand title="How to choose the right module ?" expanded="false" %}}
You have first to define what you want to evaluate :
if it is the impact of sum of physical equiment or virtual equipement (group by application portofolio or not)

Use **Information System Module** (=Inventory)
- If it is the impact of software or a digital service, according to the state of the art

Use **Digital Service Module**
- The Module Information System (=Inventory) is more configurable than Digital Service Module.

{{% expand title="Are the two modules interconnected ?" expanded="false" %}}
For the moment no but is coming soon !
The modules use same concept, same data references and same ingine to calculate impact. We target to facilitate the interconnection in the next months.
