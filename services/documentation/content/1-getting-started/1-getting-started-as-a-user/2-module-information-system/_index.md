## Introduction to Assessing the Environmental Impact of an Inventory

To integrate IT sufficiency into team activities, you do not need a formal impact evaluation. Sufficiency is a mindset
to adopt by design in every activity. This involves:

- Reducing the amount of equipment used by a team.
- Extending their lifespan (taking care of them and repairing them if necessary).
- Paying attention to their electricity consumption.

An environmental impact assessment helps identify the key contributors to the environmental impact, prioritize actions,
and manage continuous improvement over time. This makes it easier for sufficiency to become a reality.

## Global Approach

What are the main steps to adopt a sufficiency approach based on environmental impact assessment?

1. **Identify the Scope**  
   It is not mandatory to address the entire inventory from the beginning. A gradual approach is a good way to become
   familiar with the process.  
   Consider the equipment and services needed for an activity from a systemic perspective:
    - **For a public or private organization**: This includes all IT equipment (laptops, mobile phones, IoT devices,
      printers, etc.) and IT services (virtual machines, cloud services, networks, user devices, etc.) necessary to
      deliver value.
    - **For a team**: This includes all IT user devices (laptops, monitors, TVs in meeting rooms, etc.).
    - **For the collaborators of an application portfolio**: This includes all servers (physical and virtual) supporting
      the applications. This also encompasses all environments (production, integration, development, etc.), and can
      include suppliers, customers, partners, and more.

2. **Evaluate the Impact**
    - If the inventory is already in use, base your evaluation on real data.
    - You can also simulate an inventory using assumptions.

3. **Identify Major Impact Areas**  
   Identify the components of the inventory that contribute most to its environmental impact.

4. **Analyze Current Practices**  
   Assess the practices currently applied within the inventory scope.

5. **Propose an Action Plan**  
   Based on best practices, create an action plan to reduce the environmental impact of your inventory.

6. **Monitor Over Time**  
   Continuously monitor the impact to verify whether the actions taken are effective. This helps keep teams motivated
   and allows for corrective measures if necessary.

## Using G4IT for the Assessment

With G4IT, you can evaluate the impact of an inventory over a fixed duration of 1 year.
