## Visualize the Impact of Your Inventory

### Step 1: Evaluate the Impact of an Inventory

**Actions:**

- *(Optional)* Click the **Settings** button to select evaluation criteria (11 available).
    - See [Step 2](#step-2-select-evaluation-criteria) for details.
- Click **LAUNCH ESTIMATE** or **UPDATE ESTIMATE** to begin evaluation.

---

### Step 2: Select Evaluation Criteria

**Actions:**

- Select the criteria you wish to apply to your impact evaluation.
- Use the **Reset to Default** option to revert to your organizationâ€™s predefined settings.

### Step 3: Visualize the Impact

After completing an evaluation, two visualization options may become available:

1. **Equipment View**
    - Displays impacts of physical and cloud-based equipment.
    - Excludes virtual equipment hosted on owned physical servers (to avoid duplication).

2. **Application View (Beta)**
    - Shows infrastructure that supports applications (e.g., virtual servers, hypervisors, routers).

#### Step 3.1: Common Components

Both views share the following components:

- **Notes button**: Access calculation assumptions and contextual notes.
- **Export button**: Download raw data.
- **Filters**: Context-specific tools to refine results.
- **List of Evaluated Criteria**: Tabbed navigation by impact criterion.

#### Step 3.2: Equipment View Specificities

This view is divided into three primary areas:

1. **Main Graph (Left)**
    - Shows impact distribution across lifecycle stages (manufacturing, use, etc.).

2. **Guidance Panel (Top-Right)**
    - Explains scale and visual indicators.

3. **Key Indicators (Bottom-Right)**
    - Highlights key attributes of your inventory.

**Additional Actions:**

- Switch distribution view for alternative analysis.
- Check **Data Consistency** to identify missing or incomplete calculations.  
  Refer to [Data Consistency Documentation](../../../../2-functional-documentation/global_concepts/uc1_dataconsistency.md).

#### Step 3.3: Application Specificities

This view focuses on virtual infrastructure and their impacts.

1. **Histogram (Left)**
    - Displays criterion-based impact from highest to lowest.

2. **Guidance Panel (Top-Right)**
    - Details graph interpretation.

3. **Key Indicators (Bottom-Right)**
    - Displays key application infrastructure stats.

**Additional Actions:**

- Click the histogram to drill down by domain, subdomain, application, and equipment.
- Check **Data Consistency** as needed.  
  See [Data Consistency Documentation](../../../../2-functional-documentation/global_concepts/uc1_dataconsistency.md).

##### Navigating in Application View

During drill-down exploration, two additional graphs are displayed:

1. **Lifecycle Graph**
    - Shows lifecycle stage impacts of underlying physical infrastructure.

2. **Environment Graph**
    - Displays impact based on the declared application deployment environment.
