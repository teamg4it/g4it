But beware: by seeking to reduce the impact of one criterion, you run the risk of transferring the impact to another criterion or another phase of the life cycle (<a href='https://www.eco-conception.fr/static/leco-conception-les-concepts.html' target='_blank'>eco-design principles</a>). One way of avoiding this pitfall is to demonstrate sobriety at all levels of your service. <br> <h3>​ A scale suited to multi-criteria analysis: the people equivalent. </h3>​ All graphs are expressed in 'people Eq': to understand this unit, imagine defining a fixed amount for each resident of the planet, corresponding to the planetary limits that must not be exceeded individually to guarantee the overall balance of the system. This theoretical fixed amount is obtained by dividing the maximum quantity of negative externalities allowed by the Earth system (as defined <a href='https://saas-g4it.com/documentation/2-functional-documentation/global_concepts/uc2_people_equivalent/index.html' target='_blank'>in this technical report about consumption and consumer footprint</a>) by the number of people. <br> <br> ​This unit makes it possible to compare the criteria and target your eco-design action plan (see <a href='https://learninglab.gitlabpages.inria.fr/mooc-impacts-num/mooc-impacts-num-ressources/en/Partie3/FichesConcept/FC3.4.1-EcoconceptionPilierEconomieCirculaire-MoocImpactNum.html?lang=en' target='_blank'>eco-design definition</a>) on what really matters. <br> <br>​ To find out more about what's at stake: <a href='https://theshiftproject.org/en/article/lean-ict-our-new-report/' target='blank'>check this report on the environmental impact of ICT</a>. <br> <br>​ To carry out an audit of your application, the Référentiel Général d'Ecoconception de Services Numériques (<a href='https://ecoresponsable.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/referentiel-general-ecoconception/' target='_blank'>RGESN</a>) is a great starting point."
